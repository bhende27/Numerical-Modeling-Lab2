*   This file contains config options for the display of user
*   defined data functions in the Phase2 Interpreter.
*
*   Currently defined varibles for plotting are:
*
*   x    = x location associated with the stresses/displacements
*   y    = y location associated with the stresses/displacements
*   s1   = major principal stress (in-plane)
*   s3   = minor principal stress (in-plane)
*   sz   = out of plane stress
*   sxx  = stress in x direction (horizontal)
*   syy  = stress in y direction (vertical)
*   szz  = sz = stress in z direction
*   sxy  = shear stress in xy direction
*   dx   = displacement in x direction
*   dy   = displacement in y direction
*   ds1  = major principal stress change (staged excavations)
*   ds3  = minor principal stress change (staged excavations)
*   dsxx = change in stress in x direction (staged excavations)
*   dsyy = change in stress in y direction (staged excavations)
*   dszz = change in stress in z direction (staged excavations)
*   dsxy = change in shear stress in xy direction (staged excavations)
*   ddx  = change in displacement in x direction (staged excavations)
*   ddy  = change in displacement in y direction (staged excavations)
*   sf   = strength factor
*   pi   = 3.1415926
*
*   If the material is Isotropic, the elastic properties defined are:
*
*   ym  = young's modulus
*   g   = shear modulus = ym/(2*(1+pr))
*   pr  = poisson ratio
*
*   If the material is not Isotropic, the elastic properties defined are:
*
*   ym1  = young's modulus in 1 direction
*   ym2  = young's modulus in 2 direction
*   ymz  = young's modulus in z direction
*   pr12 = poisson ratio for 1-2 directions
*   pr1z = poisson ratio for 1-z directions
*   pr2z = poisson ratio for 2-z directions
*   g12  = shear modulus for 1-2 directions
*   oang = angle from x dir. ccw to 1 direction
*   uw   = unit weight of the material
*
*   NOTE: All variables and functions are case insensitive. ie. S1=s1
*
*   The following is a list of the basic mathematical operators supported:
*
*   + = addition
*   - = subtraction
*   / = division
*   * = multiplication
*   ^ = to the power of, ie 2^2 = 4
*
*   Currently defined intrinsic functions are:
*
*   acos(x)  = arc cosine of expression x
*   asin(x)  = arc sine of expression x
*   atan(x)  = arc tangent of expression x
*   cosh(x)  = hyperbolic cosine of expression x
*   sinh(x)  = hyperbolic sine of expression x
*   tanh(x)  = hyperbolic tangent of expression x
*   cos(x)   = cosine of expression x
*   sin(x)   = sine of expression x
*   tan(x)   = tangent of expression x
*   log10(x) = log base 10 of expression x
*   exp(x)   = exponential e to the x
*   log(x)   = natural logarithm of expression x
*   sqrt(x)  = square root of expression x
*   abs(x)   = integer absolute of expression x
*   fabs(x)  = floating point absolute of expression x
*
*   example: option_1 = sqrt(fabs(s3))
*                     = the square root of the absolute value of sigma 3
*
*   Note: all angles should be expressed in radians
*
******************************************************************
*
* User defined functions will only be displayed in the Interpreter
* if the user_data_menu config option is set to on.
*
* ie. user_data_menu=on
*
* By default user_data_menu=off
*
* When the user_data_menu=on, the interpreter will display a menu
* with the title defined by the value of the user_data_menu_title
* config option. This menu will contain a set of buttons, each
* button being a user specified function of stress and/or displacement,
* which allow the user to visualize the stress analysis results as
* they would like.
*
******************************************************************
user_data_menu=on
user_data_menu_title = "USER DATA"
******************************************************************
*
* The user is allowed to specify a maximum of 12 functions of
* the above variables. Each button is defined by a function of
* the form:
*
* option_? = <mathamatical expression>
*
*   where, ? = the number of the button from 1-12
*
* The button label may be specified by the value of the:
*
* option_?_title = "<button label>"
*
* The following are a list of examples that calculate different
* functions.
*
******************************************************************
option_1_title = "Sigma XX"
option_1 = sxx
option_2_title = "Sigma YY"
option_2 = syy
option_3_title = "Tau XY"
option_3 = sxy
option_4_title = "Effective Sigma XX"
option_4 = sxx-pp
option_5_title = "Effective Sigma YY"
option_5 = syy-pp
